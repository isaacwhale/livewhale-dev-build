The pilots of the Su-25 fighter aircraft ejected from the planes, the Ukrainian government said, but their whereabouts are unknown. The incidents occurred near the Russian border, in a part of the country where the government is waging a battle against pro-Russia separatists.
</p>
<p>
However, at an afternoon security briefing, a Ukraine defense spokesman said the military believes that the missiles that brought down the planes came not from separatists in Ukraine but from the Russian side of the border.
</p>
<p>
"They were downed not by terrorists," said Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for the National Security and Defense Council, using the government's term for the separatists. "â€ŽAccording to our preliminary information it was done from across the border."
